## COVID-19 Tracker Web App

<p>
  This is a <strong>COVID-19 Tracker Web App</strong>, a website where you can keep up to data related to the current Coronavirus disease.
  <br/>
  To see the live website, click here: [COVID-19 Tracker Web App](https://mechamic38-covid19-tracker.web.app/countryData)
</p>

## How It Works

<p>
  The main page <strong>(Worldwide)</strong> allows you to see data related to all the globe: clicking on the white cards (cases, recovered, deaths) you can also see different graphs showing how the disease spreads through time.
</p>

<p>
  The second page <strong>(See By Countries)</strong>, and by far the most interesting in my opinion, lets you see data related to specific countries (note: not all countries do seem to share coronavirus data, thus for some countries data will not be available).
</p>

<p>
    Data related to the Coronavirus is taken from [disease.sh](https://disease.sh)
    <br/>
    Geographical data is taken from [restcountries.eu](https://restcountries.eu)
</p>

<p>
  One thing I should mention, not all countries do seem to have uploaded data, therefore some of them won't have data available (a alert message will appear on the top of the screen).
  <br />
  I should also warn that some countries do not appear to update their status on a regular basis, so everything you might assume from looking at the disease graphs, take it with a pinch of salt.
